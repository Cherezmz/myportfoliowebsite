# **PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY**

I am a highly accomplished professional with a record of repeated success over sixteen years of legal, management and business experience. Companies such as Microsoft, Adobe Systems, Corel, and Graphisoft were among my clients and employers.

I recently moved to the US, have begun my career in software development from scratch, and graduated from three-month, 500-hour full-time and full-stack General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program. Now I am looking for a position of a junior software developer with H1B visa sponsorship.

Despite years of experience, I am looking for the salary to be commensurate with junior development role and I am confident that my extensive past experience will help me to succeed in my newly chosen career.
